Following the book The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit by Viktor Farcic:

## Notes:

- Never expose microservice API directly (use a proxy)
- Minimalist approach: only package just as much as you need in your service (smaller is better in this case)
- Version your APIs 
- "The big idea is ‘messaging’. The key in making great and growable systems is much more to design how its modules communicate rather than what their internal properties and behaviors should be." -Alan Kay
